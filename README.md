* User is given the choice of the criteria to include in the password(upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, special characters), using input from checkboxes

* User may choose length of secure password between 8 and 128 characters long and must choose criteria to generate a password

* The password is displayed on the screen in the text area

### Minimum Requirementscon

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

# Instulation

N/A at this time simple follow the url 
Select the criteria and length of password
Click Generate Password button


# Review

Ensure javascript functions are pulling the correct charCode and special characters, and resulting data is in blocks or arrays and use math floor and math random methods to return characters for password.  Loop through using length of password criteria to produce a secure password. UX funtional and bootstrap responsiveness.
